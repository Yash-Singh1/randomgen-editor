# `randomgen-editor`

Editor for RandomGen.

## Start up

```sh
npm start
```

Now the server is running on `:1579`. However, only the UI will be visible, because the `localhost` server is obviously not running on RandomGen's PHP server.

## Demo

This site is hosted on [`randomgen-editor.herokuapp.com`](http://randomgen-editor.herokuapp.com/).
