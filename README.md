# `randomgen-editor`

Editor for RandomGen.

## Start up

```sh
npm start
```

Now the server is running on `:1579`. However, since RandomGen's PHP server sends another request to the given URL, and the `localhost` is obviously not running on Randomgen's server, running RandomGen code won't be possible.

## Demo

This site is hosted on [`randomgen-editor.herokuapp.com`](http://randomgen-editor.herokuapp.com/).
